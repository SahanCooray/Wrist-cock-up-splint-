# Wrist-cock-up-splint-
This project involves the design and fabrication of a wrist cock-up splint for a patient with wrist drop (radial nerve palsy). The splint was digitally sculpted in Geomagic Freeform using a haptic device to ensure anatomical accuracy and ergonomic comfort, and was fabricated using PETG filament via FDM 3D printing.
