# 🖐️ 3D-Printed Wrist Cock-Up Splint  
Custom-designed using Geomagic Freeform + Haptic Device

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project features a **wrist cock-up splint** designed for a patient with **radial nerve palsy (wrist drop)**. Using **Geomagic Freeform** and a **haptic device**, I sculpted a splint that holds the wrist in approximately **25° extension** — promoting function, reducing strain, and allowing finger mobility.

The splint was printed using **PETG** for strength, flexibility, and patient comfort.
